-> Normalization: 
   * Information Retrieval: indexed text and the query terms must have the same form
   	U.S.A			-> USA
   * Implicitly define equivalence classes of terms
   * Alternatively, asymmetric expansion
   * Case folding:
     Reduce all letters to lower case
     Exceptions:
	: General Motors, Fed vs fed, SAIL vs sail
     For sentiment analysis, MT, IE case is helpful.

-> Lemmatization:
   Reduce inflections or variant forms to base form
	: am, are, is			-> be
	: car, cars, car's, cars'	-> car
	: the boy's cars are different colors	-> the boy car be different color
   Find the correct dictionary headword form

-> Morphemes:
   * Morphology: The study of morphemes
   * Morphemes: The smallest meaningful units that make up words
   * Types: 
	Stems: The core meaning-bearing units
	Affixes: Bits and pieces that adhere to stems (Often with grammatical functions).
		: Cars		-> [Car] [s]
				   STEM  AFFX

-> Stemming:
   * Reduce terms to their stems by removing the affixes in information retrieval.
     : for example compressed and compression are both accepted as equivalent to compress.
       for exampl  compress   and compress    ar  both accept   as equival    to compress.
   * Porter Algorith: The most common English Stemmer (bunch of iterated series of simple rules)
