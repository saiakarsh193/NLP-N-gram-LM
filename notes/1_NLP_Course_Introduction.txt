Applications of Language Technology:
-> Mostly solved:
* Spam detection
	: Lets go to Agra! (NOT SPAM)
	: Buy VIAGRA (SPAM)
* Part-of-speech (POS) tagging
	: Colourless green ideas sleep furiously
	     ADJ      ADJ  NOUN  VERB     ADV
* Named entity recognition (NER)
	: Einstein met with UN officials in Princeton
	   PERSON          ORG                LOC

-> Making good progress:
* Sentiment analysis
	: Best roast chicken in San Francisco! (Thumbs up)
	: The waiter ignored us for 20 minutes (Thumbs down)
* Coreference resolution
* Word sense disambiguation (WSD)
	: Mouse can be an animal or an electronic device.
* Parsing <creating the phrase structure or some other dependency tree structure>
* Machine Translation (MT)
* Information Extraction (IE) <Extracting for example info from a mail and creating a calender event)

-> Still really hard:
* Question answering (QA) <answering really complicated human level questions for maybe a search>
	: How effective is ibuprofen in reducing fever in patients with acute febrile illness?
* Paraphrase <restatement with different words but no loss in meaning>
* Summarization <creating a summary from a context>
* Dialog <highest level problem, where there is human-human level interaction with a model>

Problems in NPL:
* Ambiguity makes NLP hard <Not only WSD but also the structure ambiguity makes it hard for the parsing>
	: Red tape holds up new bridges
* Non standard English <Usage of hash tags and informal english in social media>
* Segmentation issues
	: the New York-New Haven Railroad
	  [the] [New] [York-New] [Haven] [Railroad]
	  [the] [New York] - [Haven] [Railroad]
* Idioms
* Neologisms <new words created, trend words, words created due to the digital and social age>
	: Unfriend
	: Retweet
* World knowledge
	: Mary and Sue are sisters.
	: Mary and Sue are mothers.
* Tricky entity names <sometimes links and titles are part of the text, making it harder to separate and tag>
	: Where is A Bug's Life playing...
